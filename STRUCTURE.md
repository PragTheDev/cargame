## üéÆ Features

### Core Systems

- **Physics Engine**: Cannon.js for realistic car physics and collision detection
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for professional rendering with shadows and lighting
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

### Camera Modes

1. **Follow Camera** (Key: 1) - Mouse-controlled camera that orbits around the car
2. **Chase Camera** (Key: 2) - Fixed camera that follows behind the car
3. **First Person** (Key: 3) - Driver's view from inside the car

### Controls

- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** - Drive the car
- **Mouse** - Look around (in Follow camera mode)
- **1, 2, 3** - Switch between camera modes

### World Features

- Large 500x500 unit world
- Comprehensive road network with markings
- Dynamic obstacles course with:
  - Traffic cones (can be knocked over)
  - Concrete barriers
  - Buildings and structures
  - Cylindrical pillars
  - Jump ramps
- Professional lighting system with multiple light sources

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Benefits

### Modular Design

- **Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Reusability**: Modules can be easily reused or swapped
- **Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific modules
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested separately

### Clean Architecture

- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript module system
- **Class-based**: Object-oriented approach for better organization
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules receive dependencies rather than creating them
- **Event-driven**: Loose coupling between modules

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Physics**: Optimized physics simulation with proper materials
- **Smart Rendering**: Professional lighting with LOD considerations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management
- **Smooth Animations**: Interpolated camera movements and car physics

## üéØ Future Enhancements

The modular structure makes it easy to add new features:
